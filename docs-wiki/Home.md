# Welcome to the IW4x Wiki!

**IW4x** is a modification of the game **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2**, developed by **Infinity Ward.**

The goal of this modification is to finish the - in our eyes - unfinished development of the PC version of **Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2**, like other projects (e.g. **alterIWNet** and **fourDeltaOne**) did in the past.

## Core Features
* rewritten from scratch
* decentralized backend
* dedicated servers (party and match mode)
* mod support, includes an integrated zonebuilder to build your own fastfiles (e.g. a mod.ff)
* improved user interface
* theater mode
* support for leaning
* offline playable lan mode
* **and much more...**
