This is how you configure your server to run as a party server.

## Server config

This part of the configuration has to be done in the server.cfg file that your server is using. Please put your server configuration file in the `Players` folder in your MW2 root directory.

[General](https://github.com/Jawesome99/IW4x/wiki/Advanced-general-server-configuration) server configuration is required for general configuration options.

Required mod configuration has to be done in this file as well.

## Playlist config

The following configuration has to be done in your playlist. Do not edit your `iw4x/playlist_default.info` file directly as this file is updated via the updater and will be resetted to defaults.

Instead put your playlist in the `players` folder in your MW2 root directory.

### General

Playlists are limited to 32 Gametypes and 23 playlists. It is possible to create multiple seperate playlists. A single server can only run a single playlist at a time.

### Function script

In playlists you can use the following parameters to configure your game server:

* `gametype <string>`: Unique name for your configured gametype. Everything until the next gametype configures your gametype. Eg.: `gametype tdm`
* `name <string> "<string>"`: Configures a specific localized name for the gametype which is shown to the user. Eg.: `name english "Team Deathmatch"`
* `script`: Gametype the game actually loads. Eg.: `script war`
* More gametypes can be found [here](https://github.com/Jawesome99/IW4x/wiki/Advanced-general-server-configuration#supported-gametypes)
* `teambased`: Currently unknown
* `hardcore`: Currently unknown
* `rule <string> <string>`: Rule is used to customize dvars. Eg.: `rule scr_thirdperson 0`
* For possible values you can check the options for your preferred gametype [here](https://github.com/Jawesome99/IW4x/wiki/Advanced-match-server-configuration#server-config)

### Playlist

The first playlist in your file has to be `playlist 1`. To start this playlist on your server, you have to pass the parameter `+set playlist 0`.

* `playlist <int>`: Configures playlist
* `rule <string> <string>`: Overwrites rules configured in your function.
* `<mapname>,<gametype>,<mapweight>`: Configures your playlist. Put every map you want in your map rotation on a seperate line. The higher the mapweight the more likely this map will be picked. Eg.: `mp_rust,tdm,4` or `mp_fuel2,tdm,1`
